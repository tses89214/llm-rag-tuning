# llm-rag-tuning
This project is a hands-on exercise designed to practice and demonstrate skills in working with Prompt Engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning.


## Project Overview  

This project we use **fake product data** for a series of `Consumer-Level Spaceships` called **Stark Spaceships**.  
The Stark Spaceships range from models 1 to 10, with each model offering unique features, including variations in **size**, **color**, **pricing**, and **target customer groups**.  

You can find the generated product data in the `data/stark_spaceships` folder.
